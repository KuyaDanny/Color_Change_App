# Color_Change_App
# Overview

The purpose of this App is initially to give myself some experience on App development. Since this is my first time makinga an app I wanted
to do something simple so that I could get the basics of app development down. I wanted to make an app that had 2 buttons. One to change
the color of the background and another to use the phone's speaker to say the color of the background.

# Development Environment

In making this project I used the tools mainly provided by anroid studio which included text to speech and color import. As well as
the simple to use app layout creator. For this app I utilized Kotlin programming language instead of Java to see the differences.
